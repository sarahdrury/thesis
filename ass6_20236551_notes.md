### MA5114 Assignment 6
#### Student name: Sarah Drury
#### Student ID: 20236551

Git was installed and a GitHub account was set-up. The tutorial by Blischak et al., 2016. was followed.

First, name and email was set by running the following code.

        $ git config --global user.name "Sarah Drury"
        
        $ git config --global user.email "smidrury@gmail"

A new subdirectory called "thesis" was created and navigated to. The command *git init* was ran to initialize the current folder as a Git repository.

        $ mkdir thesis
        
        $ cd /thesis
        
        $ git init
        
        Initialized empty Git repository in /home/sarah/masters/lectures/MA5114/thesis/.git/

This file, "ass6_20236551_notes.md" was then created to record the process.

        $ nano ass6_20236551_notes.md

The tarfile created in the previous practical (practical 21) was then copied to this subdirectory and untarred.

        $ cp ../FastQC/hiv_study/prac21.tar ./

        $ tar xvf prac21.tar

To follow what Git is doing as the initial version of the files is recorded, the command *git status* is used. It displays the untracked files and those which have been staged or not staged. Most of the files are excluded for brevity. 

        $ git status
        
        On branch master

        Initial commit

        Untracked files:
        
          (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
        
            .ipynb_checkpoints/
        
            README.txt
        
            ass6_20236551_notes.md
    

The file README.txt was added to the staging area and *git status* was checked again.

        $ git status
        
        On branch master

        Initial commit

        Changes to be committed:

          (use "git rm --cached <file>…" to unstage)

            new file:   prac21.tar

        Untracked files:
        
          (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
        
            .ipynb_checkpoints/
            

The rest of the files were then added to the staging area and committed.

        $ git add fastqc_script.py trimm_script.py test_dataset/ fastqc_out/ trim_out/
        
        $ git commit -m "Add initial version of thesis code."

        [master (root-commit) 49fd3af] Add initial version of thesis code.
        
         52 files changed, 46881 insertions(+)

         create mode 100644 fastqc_out/exampleHIV.interleaved.part-01_fastqc.html


To view the record of each commit, the command *git log* is used.

        $ git log
        
        commit 49fd3aff9764a9b578b6729abfb71725ba89ff21 (HEAD -> master)

        Add initial version of thesis code.

Now, changes can be freely made to the files and then reverted to this commit. As an example, the first line of the file exampleHIV.interleaved.part-01.fastq in the test_dataset folder was changed to "test" using *nano*. Because Git is tracking the file, it recognizes that it has been changed since the last commit.


        $ git status
        
        On branch master
        
        Changes not staged for commit:
        
          (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
          
          (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
          
            modified:   ../ass6_20236551_notes.md
            
            modified:   exampleHIV.interleaved.part-01.fastq


The report from *git status* indicates that the changes to exampleHIV.interleaved.part-01.fastq are not staged. To view the unstaged changes, the command *git diff* is used.


        $ git diff exampleHIV.interleaved.part-01.fastq
        
        diff --git a/test_dataset/exampleHIV.interleaved.part-01.fastq b/test_dataset/exampleHIV.interleaved.part-01.fastq
        
        index 2b3f402..5ca3c1b 100644

Any lines of text that have been added to the script are indicated with a +, and any lines that have been removed with a -.

The edit can be reverted by following the directions from the output of *git status* to “discard changes in the working directory” using the command *git restore*.

        $ git restore test_dataset/exampleHIV.interleaved.part-01.fastq

*git diff* test_dataset/exampleHIV.interleaved.part-01.fastq now does not produce an output as the file has been restored.

A new repository called "thesis" was then created under the GitHub account. In order to link the local thesis repository to the remote repository, in the local repository Git is given the URL of the remote repository using the command *git remote add*.

        $ git remote add origin https://github.com/sarahdrury/thesis.git

The code is sent to GitHub using the command *git push*, where the remote repository is “origin” and the “master” copy of the repository is being pushed.

        $ git push origin master

URL to repository: https://github.com/sarahdrury/thesis
